Hi, nice to meet you! 👋🏽
------

I'm a data science enthusiast with over 6 years _(and counting!)_ of experience working in the tech field. I am passionate about solving complex and challenging problems in the world by applying machine learning algorithms and statistical methods. In my professional experience, I have conducted analyses across the fintech, academic/research, healthcare, and supply chain industries. 

I have also developed a deep understanding of data management requirements, and building efficient solutions to support business initiatives. I am skilled in creating data pipelines using the best suited tools, and harnessing cloud technologies to build scalable and reliable solutions.

I **love** working on projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!
